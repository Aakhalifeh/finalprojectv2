# VERSION 2
#### The program is a fun number guessing game where you try to figure out a secret number. You get to choose how hard or easy you want it to be. The game gives you hints along the way and tells you if your guess is too high or too low. It's just a simple, entertaining game to test your guessing skills and have a good time!
#### The real deal is the break in the loop. It's like the magic word â€“ stops the game when you hit the right number. Without it, we'd be stuck in a guessing loop forever. It adds that smooth control to the game.
